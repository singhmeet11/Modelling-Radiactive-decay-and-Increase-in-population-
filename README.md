# Modelling-Radiactive-decay-and-Increase-in-population
The Radioactive decay/Increase in Population and RLC cirucit problems can be expressed by differential equations. The equation for radioactive decay/Increase in Poputlation can be given by

where N is the population at some particular time t. The equation for an RLC circuit can be derived from the Kirchoff Voltage and  Current laws. The equation for one example is given below(the cirucit can found in photos)-

## Laplace transform to solve differential equations
Laplce tranform is defined as
